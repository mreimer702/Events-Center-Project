This is the Events Center Project, the first project I have completed for Coding Temple. For this project, I used the Red Oak Victory as the example events center. The events, menu pages, and hours are of my own creation, but all other information is accurate as of February 9, 2025. There is a home page, an events page (with a very simple tickets page), a menu page, a location page and a contact page. They have been completed using the instructions provided by Coding Temple for this project. If there are any other questions for this project, please let me know.
